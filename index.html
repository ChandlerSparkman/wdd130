            <p>Hi! My name is Chandler Sparkman. I live in Germantown, Tennessee and work at Memphis Escape Rooms. I
                like to
                play video games, DND, and code! My favorite movie is <b>Scott Pilgrim V.S. the World</b>, my favorite
                podcast is <b>The Adventure Zone</b> by the McElroy Family, and my favorite games kind fluctuate, but
                the
                common suspects are <b>Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</b>, <b>Terraria</b>, and <b>Bioshock</b>.
                <br><br><b>Terraria</b> is actually the reason I got into coding. I didn't have a computer as a kid, so
                I
                was
                mainly
                playing on my phone. I ended up getting a tad lazy, and straight up taught myself how to hex-edit in
                order
                to edit my inventory and give myself all the most power items. Seeing the inner workings of this game I
                loved so much was FASCINATING.
            </p>

            <p>I live in Germantown, Tennessee! Its a relatively quaint place, doesn't have as much going on as the
                nearby
                Memphis per se, but its safe and comfortable. That and we have a festival every year that includes a
                wiener
                dog race, so I'm happy.</p>
