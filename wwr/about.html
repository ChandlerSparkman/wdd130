                <p>Here at SPLASH, our mission is to take the joys of white water rafting from the "oh yeah that'd be
                    fun"
                    prison, and into your actual plans. With included transportation, rafts, and snacks in every
                    package, we
                    take the stress away from planning a river outing. Lets make a SPLASH!</p>

                <p>Our company was founded by a Ms. Jane S. River. When she was 12, she was attending a camp out with
                    her
                    family in which she got too close to a cliff face and was sent careening into the river below.
                    Splashing
                    and floating, desperately fighting the current for air. For most? A nightmare. A reason to never
                    visit
                    the wilderness again. For Jane? She had never felt more alive.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>As she sat on the riverbank, towel
                    wrapped tightly around her, her family weeping tears of joy at her safety, all she could think
                    about
                    was
                    when she could do it again. A bit more safely this time of course. Fast forward a few years, and
                    SPLASH was born! A way for Jane to share that thrill without the life threatening circumstances.
